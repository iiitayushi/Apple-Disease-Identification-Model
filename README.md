This project is the implementation of the Research Paper Transformer Help CNN See Better: A Lightweight Hybrid Apple Disease Identification Model Based on Transformers by Xiaopeng Li and Shuqin Li *.
This project proposed a model which identifies different disease in apple leaf.Apple is a major fruit species today and is very popular. However, apple leaf diseases seriously affect its yield and quality. 
Therefore, timely and accurate identification of apple leaf diseases is essential to improve apple yield and quality and promote the apple industryâ€™s healthy development. Farmers relied on planting experience and expert
guidance to diagnose diseases in the early days. However, with the expansion of the planting scale, this method could no longer meet practical needs. The development of machine learning has provided a new approach to crop disease identification.
